This is used to simulate mouse scrolling in the application that you choose. It is a very lightweight program.
This was developed in Visual Studios 2017  C# Winform
First Select how fast you want the mouse will to scroll in seconds. I found that .05 works good for minecraft for random block selection. Then
you want to select which program you want to run. Minecraft is run under javaw process name. Once these two fields are selected, simply alt +
tab into the application you want it to run in and it will start To Stop just bring up the this application and it will automatically stop. Be sure to
close the mouse wheel scrolling application to permenently stop the scrolling.
